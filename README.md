ROBLOX MASS UNBLOCKER
Efficient. Minimalist. Automated.
A lightweight browser extension designed to automate the tedious process of clearing your blocked list on Roblox. No more manual confirmations for every single user.

🛠 INSTALLATION GUIDE
Since this extension is in development, you need to load it manually into your browser:

Download the source: Save all project files (manifest.json, popup.html, popup.js) into a dedicated folder.

Open Extensions page: In your Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, or Brave), go to chrome://extensions/.

Enable Developer Mode: Toggle the switch in the top right corner.

Load the project: Click the Load unpacked button and select the folder containing your files.

📖 HOW TO USE
To ensure the extension works correctly, follow these specific steps:

Step 1: Navigate to the Roblox Privacy Settings:

https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/privacy

Step 2: Scroll to the bottom and click the Show button under the Blocked Users section.

Step 3: Confirm your URL matches exactly:

https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/privacy/BlockedUsers

Step 4: Open the extension, select your language, and press START.

Note: Do not close the tab while the process is running. The script will automatically scroll and unblock users until the list is empty.

🧪 TECHNOLOGIES & STACK
Built with a focus on performance and a modern aesthetic, using no external dependencies:

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) using the Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3).

Interface: Custom CSS with iOS-inspired Glassmorphism and blur effects.

Storage: Chrome Local Storage API to persist user language preferences.

Automation: High-speed DOM manipulation with built-in safety delays to prevent rate-limiting.
